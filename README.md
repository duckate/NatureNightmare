# NatureNightmare

I guess I was inspired by both the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch and the fact that I saw perhaps the best horror movie ever on Monday, so I came up with the idea of a horror based text game in which you are stuck in a nightmare and have to find medallions to escape.
I found the most basic way to do this was in html, and as I've never really coded in web based designs before I searched for an app that would help me take my vision into a reality. Several hours and approximately four thousand and two hundred words later I ended up with this.
So test it out! See how many attempts it takes you to find a medallion, and see if you can find all of the different options.

A warning: this will not run on Safari, I recommend either Chrome or Firefox.
